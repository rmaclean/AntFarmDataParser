# AntFarmDataParser
Small CLI tool to parse data from [AntFarm streaming service](https://www.antfarm.co.za) out to CSV for data analysis.
Very tailored to my use (especially for view stats), but maybe a nice start for your project.

## Usage

`dotnet run -- --view-stats`: Prints out view times per presenter
`dotnet run -- --browser-stats`: Prints out browsers information
